If we both choose to Share, we each guarantee $1,000 — a solid reward without the risk of mutual loss.

       "*Влетаю в огромную пещеру, освещённую багровым заревом от расплавленной лавы в глубине, и с грохотом приземляюсь на гору золотых монет, черепов и древних сокровищ, после чего разжимаю хвост, позволяя принцессе упасть на холодный каменный пол.*\n",

Это для особо строптивых гостей... Хотя, знаешь что, пока не буду тебя сажать на цепь — посмотрим, насколько ты \"добровольная\". — *ложусь на гору золота, положив морду на лапы, и сверлю её взглядом* — Давай-ка, принцесска, развлеки меня. Расскажи, например, как собираешься меня \"полюбить\"? Или может, сразу признаешься, что врала, пытаясь выиграть время для своего жестяного дурачка? — *облизываю клыки, наслаждаясь её страхом и беспомощностью* — В любом случае, детка, отныне ты — моя. И чем быстрее смиришься с этим, тем... ну, скажем так, тем меньше будешь плакать по ночам.\n"
